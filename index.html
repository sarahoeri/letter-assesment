    <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
    <p1>Dear Eileen,

            Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
            
            </p1>
            <h2>Starting dates</h2>
            <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>

               <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
               <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility â€” as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
               </p>
               <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>
             <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
             <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
              
                      <p>For more of my research, see my exotic dance research page.</p>    
                      <p>Yours sincerely,
                            Dr Eleanor Gaye</p>  
                            <p>
